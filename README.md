# Forecasting of COVID Airline Stocks

This repo includes a personal project into stock forecasting using endogenous and exogenous data. The project is entirely encapsulated in the form of a Jupyter Notebook. 
The notebook is laid out as a pseudo-tutorial into the end-to-end process for time-series data analysis, with subsections for each step. In this way, package installations are not a necessity - the notebook can be viewed as is.

# Rendering of Jupyter Notebook

Due to the size and contents of the notebook (pre-initialised data visualisation), you may find diffficulty in rendering it on GitHub.
If the notebook file does not render in GitHub, please paste GitHub repository link into main text field at https://deepnote.com/viewer
